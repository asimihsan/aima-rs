# Contributing to the project

Please read the [README](README.md) file for an introduction to the project.

## Goals

The goal of the project includes implementing a wide range of algorithms and
concepts from the textbook. The code is intended to be well-documented and easy
to understand, making it suitable for both students and professionals. However,
in many sections the textbook is merely a starting point for further research.
The goal of this project is not to provide state-of-the-art implementations of
the algorithms and concepts.

## Contribution guidelines

1. Code must reference "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart
Russell and Peter Norvig, 2nd or 3rd edition. The code should be a direct
implementation of the algorithms and concepts presented in the textbook.
2. Code must be well-documented. Each function should have a doc comment
describing the purpose of the function and the parameters and return values.
3. Code must be well-tested. Each function should have unit tests that cover
the expected behavior of the function.
4. All major components need at least one motivating end-to-end example. This
example should be included in the `examples` directory and should be runnable
with `cargo run --example <example_name>`.
