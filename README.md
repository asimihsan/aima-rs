## Introduction

This project aims to provide Rust code implementations for the algorithms and
concepts presented in the textbook "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"
by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The purpose of this project is to make the
algorithms and concepts from the textbook more accessible to developers by
providing working code that can be used as a learning tool or as a starting
point for further development.

## Goals

The goal of the project includes implementing a wide range of algorithms and
concepts from the textbook, including search algorithms, probabilistic
reasoning, and machine learning. The code is intended to be well-documented and
easy to understand, making it suitable for both students and professionals in
the field of Artificial Intelligence.

However, in many sections the textbook is merely a starting point for further
research. The goal of this project is not to provide state-of-the-art
implementations of the algorithms and concepts, but rather to provide a
starting point for further development.
